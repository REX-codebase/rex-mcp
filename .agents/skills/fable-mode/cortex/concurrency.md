# Cortical Lobe: `concurrency`

> Activation count: 17.

## Metadata & Telemetry
- **Name**: `concurrency`
- **Description**: Lock-free synchronization, atomic memory ordering, and race hardening
- **Domain**: `concurrency`
- **Activation Count**: `17`
- **Total Antibodies**: `3`
- **Specialized Heuristics**: `5`
- **Last Consolidated**: `2026-09-04T12:00:00+00:00`

## Specialized Domain Heuristics
1. Atomic CAS Loops: Always use compare_exchange_weak in retry loops to handle spurious LL/SC failures on ARM architectures, falling back to compare_exchange_strong only for single attempts.
2. Memory Ordering Discipline: Use Acquire on loads paired with Release on stores for synchronized handoffs; never default blindly to SeqCst when Acquire-Release suffices.
3. ABA Hazard Prevention: Prevent recycled pointer hazards in lock-free stacks using tagged atomic pointers (pointer + 64-bit generation counter) or hazard pointer epochs.
4. TOCTOU Eradication: In concurrent state checks and transitions, the validation and state mutation must occur within a single atomic primitive or critical section.
5. Hierarchical Lock Ordering: Prevent distributed deadlocks by establishing a strict total order (L1 < L2 < L3) across all mutex acquisitions.
