# Cortical Lobe: `research`

> First-principles epistemology, causal DAG inference, and TRIZ contradiction resolution
> Activation count: 17.

## Metadata & Telemetry
- **Name**: `research`
- **Description**: First-principles epistemology, causal DAG inference, and TRIZ contradiction resolution
- **Domain**: `research`
- **Activation Count**: `17`
- **Total Antibodies**: `3`
- **Specialized Heuristics**: `6`
- **Last Consolidated**: `2026-09-04T12:00:00+00:00`

## Specialized Domain Heuristics
1. Mandatory Zero-Cost Research: When external research is needed, use Fable's zero-cost research scrapers before deliberation or subagent dispatch.
2. First-Principles Synthesis: Deconstruct complex empirical claims into fundamental physical, mathematical, or algorithmic axioms before synthesizing conclusions.
3. Counterfactual Citation Validation: Every paper citation or benchmark figure must cite a primary DOI, arXiv ID, or verified source URL; never cite ungrounded second-hand summaries.
4. Cross-Source Contradiction Resolution: When two reputable sources disagree, resolve the dialectical tension by identifying differing hidden boundary conditions (e.g. workload profile, hardware architecture, caching layers).
5. Epistemic State Partitioning: Explicitly tag propositions as [PROVEN] (receipt backed), [HYPOTHESIS] (untested inference), or [UNKNOWN] (unmeasured parameter).
6. Causal vs Correlative Discipline: Construct a Pearlian Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) before claiming intervention efficacy; rule out confounding and collider bias.
